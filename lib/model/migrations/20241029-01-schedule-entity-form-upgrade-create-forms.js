// The previous migration only added this event for forms with an
// update action, which should have been entity spec version 2023.1.0.
// We also need to flag 2022.1.0 forms with the create action.
// To avoid flagging forms that do both create + update twice, this
// migration captures the complement set of forms.
// Basically, every existing form should be flagged, but I didn't want
// to change an old migration.
